Repository and Unit of Work Pattern:

Repository Pattern:
To create an abstract data access layer for the application which allows to centralise all the data access logic in on
place. with generic feature, we can reduce the amount of code we need for common scenarios.

Unit of Work Pattern: 
To combine a set of interactions and commit them at once using a transaction.

The implementation contains different layers:
1. Database (to manage data)
2. Data Access Layer (contain EF LINQ queries, models and datacontext)
3. Service Layer (Business and domain Logic)
4. MVC Web Layer (UI part which talks to service layer only)

Steps to creating the application:
1. Added an empty MVC application
2. Then added other class libraries for Model, Repository and Service
